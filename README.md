# Assembler

Assembler is an OSINT data discovery tool that scraps among the Have I Been Pwned and Hunter.io databases using a corporate email as the search term. It returns a view of those emails which have been related to major data exfiltrations and the personal data that may appear, alongside with a verification service to evaluate the confidence that it gives.

This tool allows the bulk search by inputting a CSV file with a list of emails to be analysed and generating a report with all the data contained on those databases. A Have I Been Pwned and Hunter.io is necessary to run this tool.
